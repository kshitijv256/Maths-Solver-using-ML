# Maths-Solver-using-ML

Hi! I'm Kshitij and This is my very first project on Github.

It can be used to solve Arithmetic problems with +, - and * operators.

In this project I converted Image dataset from kaggle(link below in reference) to labeled ".csv" file and trained 3 Different ML models

- **Support Vector Machine**
- **K Nearest Neighbours**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

After trying all 3 of them multiple times SVM model seems best fit for this task.
I have seen various similar works done using Deep Learning but I wanted to give this a try using Machine learning

> It is a fun way to understand working of different Machine learning algorithms

## Examples
